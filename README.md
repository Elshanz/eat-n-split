# Eat and Split - React App

Eat and Split is a React app that helps two friends split bills when dining together. Whether you're going out for lunch, dinner, or any other occasion, this app will help you accurately calculate each friend's share of the bill, considering how much each person paid, and whether they owe each other any remaining amount.

## Features

- Easy bill splitting: Input the total bill amount and the individual payments made by each friend to calculate the remaining amount owed by one friend to the other.
- Real-time updates: Instantly see the calculated amounts as you make changes to the bill details.
- Fair distribution: Ensure both friends pay their fair share, considering the payments they made.

## Usage

- Enter the total bill amount in the designated input field.
- Specify the payments made by each friend. For example, if you paid $50, and your friend paid $30, enter these amounts accordingly.
- The app will automatically calculate the remaining amount owed by one friend to the other.
- Review the results to see how much one friend owes the other, or if the bills are fully settled.
